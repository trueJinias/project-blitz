## Introduction

"Do you really need all that stuff?"

In 2026, with the complete fusion of remote and office work, a businessman's carry has become more minimal than ever.
But simply reducing items isn't the answer. You need to be prepared.

The goal is **"Maximum performance with minimum gear."**
Here are 5 EDC (Everyday Carry) items selected for the urban businessman in his 30s who values functional beauty.

## 1. MagSafe Slim Wallet

The era of carrying a bulky wallet is over.
A MagSafe-compatible wallet that snaps onto the back of your phone is all you need for your ID and main credit card.

**Why it's great:**
- **MOFT or ESR** with stand functionality is the best choice.
- It's a phone stand at your desk, and a wallet on the move.
- Models with built-in tracking tags offer peace of mind.

## 2. GaN Compact Charger

"Running out of battery" is the biggest sin in modern business.
But carrying a brick-like AC adapter is not smart.

Gallium Nitride (GaN) chargers are now golf-ball sized yet powerful enough to charge a PC.
A 2-in-1 type that also functions as a mobile bank is invincible even when cafe outlets are full.

## 3. Noise-Canceling Key Organizer

Stop the "jingle-jangle".
A key organizer that smartly stores your keys is a mark of a refined adult.
In 2026 models, built-in tracking tags are becoming standard. A tiny LED light for unlocking your door at night is also a handy feature.

## 4. Open-Ear Wireless Earbuds

You want to block out city noise, but not miss important info.
Bone conduction or open-ear earbuds let you listen to music while still noticing a colleague calling your name or a station announcement.
They don't fatigue your ears even after long hours, making them essentially a part of your body.

## 5. Bladeless Multi-Tool

Think "Multi-tool = Knife"?
You can't carry a knife in the city (it scares people in the office, aside from legal issues).

Scissors, package openers, screwdrivers, bottle openers.
A "Bladeless" multi-tool with these integrated functions is safe for travel (depending on the product) and solves those daily "little problems" like cutting tags or tightening screws.

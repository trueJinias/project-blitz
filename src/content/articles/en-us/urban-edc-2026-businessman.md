"Do you really need all that stuff?"

In 2026, with the complete fusion of remote and office work, a businessman's carry has become more minimal than ever.
But simply reducing items isn't the answer. You need to be prepared.

The goal is **"Maximum performance with minimum gear."**
Here are 5 EDC (Everyday Carry) items selected for the urban businessman in his 30s who values functional beauty.

## 1. MagSafe Slim Wallet

"Running out of battery" is the biggest sin in modern business.
But carrying a brick-like AC adapter is not smart.

Gallium Nitride (GaN) chargers are now golf-ball sized yet powerful enough to charge a PC.
The **Anker 735 Charger (Nano II 65W)** is invincible even when cafe outlets are full.

Think "Multi-tool = Knife"?
You can't carry a knife in the city (it scares people in the office, aside from legal issues).

A "Bladeless" multi-tool like the **Victorinox Jetsetter** is safe for travel and solves those daily "little problems" like cutting tags or tightening screws.

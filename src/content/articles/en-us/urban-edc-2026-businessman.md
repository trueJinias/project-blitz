## Introduction

"Do you really need all that stuff?"

In 2026, with the complete fusion of remote and office work, a businessman's carry has become more minimal than ever.
But simply reducing items isn't the answer. You need to be prepared.

The goal is **"Maximum performance with minimum gear."**
Here are 5 EDC (Everyday Carry) items selected for the urban businessman in his 30s who values functional beauty.

## 1. MagSafe Slim Wallet

The era of carrying a bulky wallet is over.
A MagSafe-compatible wallet that snaps onto the back of your phone is all you need for your ID and main credit card.

**Why it's great:**
- **ESR Aura MagSafe Wallet & Stand** (supports "Find My") or **MOFT**'s stand-equipped versions are the gold standard.

## 2. GaN Compact Charger

"Running out of battery" is the biggest sin in modern business.
But carrying a brick-like AC adapter is not smart.

Gallium Nitride (GaN) chargers are now golf-ball sized yet powerful enough to charge a PC.
The **Anker 735 Charger (Nano II 65W)** is invincible even when cafe outlets are full.

## 3. Noise-Canceling Key Organizer

Stop the "jingle-jangle".
A key organizer that smartly stores your keys is a mark of a refined adult.
The **Orbitkey Key Organizer Pro** lets you integrate tracking tags beautifully while keeping a slim profile.

## 4. Open-Ear Wireless Earbuds

You want to block out city noise, but not miss important info.
Bone conduction or open-ear earbuds let you listen to music while still noticing a colleague calling your name.
The **Bose Ultra Open Earbuds** offer premium sound and total situational awareness without ear fatigue.

## 5. Bladeless Multi-Tool

Think "Multi-tool = Knife"?
You can't carry a knife in the city (it scares people in the office, aside from legal issues).

A "Bladeless" multi-tool like the **Victorinox Jetsetter** is safe for travel and solves those daily "little problems" like cutting tags or tightening screws.

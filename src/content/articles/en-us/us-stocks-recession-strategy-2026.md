**How should you position your portfolio for 2026?**

Goldman Sachs estimates recession risk at around 20%. That sounds low — but complacency is dangerous. Between Trump's tariff policies, potential AI bubble collapse, and inflation acceleration in late 2026, a "full bull" approach could backfire.

Here's how to build a **recession-resistant portfolio**.

## 1. 2026 Economic Outlook

Key forecasts from major institutions:

| Institution | Outlook |
|-------------|---------|
| **Goldman Sachs** | 20% recession risk; economy remains strong |
| **Nomura** | Global economy reaccelerates; US capex expansion |
| **Sumitomo Mitsui** | Solid growth from tax cuts; slightly elevated inflation |

Looks positive, but **risks lurk beneath the surface**.

What could derail the bull market:

-   **Inflation reacceleration** (H2 2026)
-   **Trump tariffs/immigration policy** — potential economic drag
-   **AI bubble burst** — tech stock crash risk
-   **Elevated interest rates** — pressure on corporate earnings

Particularly dangerous: **overconcentration in AI stocks**. Massive capex spending is already squeezing margins.

## 3. What Are Defensive Stocks?

Time to learn about **recession-resistant investments**.

**Characteristics of Defensive Stocks:**
-   Less sensitive to economic cycles
-   Essential products/services
-   Stable dividend yields
-   Lower volatility

**Key Sectors:**
| Sector | Why It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Consumer Staples** | Food, medicine, household goods — demand doesn't drop |
| **Utilities** | Power, gas, water — essential services |
| **Telecom** | Cell service, internet — modern necessities |
| **Healthcare** | Medical demand is recession-proof |

## 4. Top 5 Defensive Stocks

Specific picks to consider:

### 1. Procter & Gamble (PG)
Consumer goods giant. Pampers, Gillette, Tide.

### 2. Coca-Cola (KO)
Buffett's longtime holding. Dividend king.

## 5. Portfolio Defense Tactics

How to recession-proof your investments:

-   Consider Treasuries and investment-grade corporate

**③ Hedge with Gold**

What NOT to do in a downturn:

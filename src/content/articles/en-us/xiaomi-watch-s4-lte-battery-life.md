## Introduction

In a market dominated by the Apple Watch and Galaxy Watch, the **Xiaomi Watch S4** is a breath of fresh air—primarily because it doesn't need to breathe (charge) every single night.

While not officially sold in the US, this device is turning heads for importers. Why? Because it promises **15 days of battery life**.

But here's the catch: That's without LTE. We tested the Global ROM import version to see if it can survive the American reliable-network lifestyle.

## 1. Battery Life: Pixel Watch vs. Xiaomi S4

The Apple Watch Series 10 manages 18 hours. The Pixel Watch 3 gets about 24.
The Xiaomi Watch S4?

- **Standard Mode (Bluetooth):** ~12 Days (Real world)
- **LTE Mode (Active):****3-4 Days**Yes, you read that right. Even with LTE punishing the battery, it lasts**3x longer** than its US competitors. For a weekend camping trip to Joshua Tree, you can leave the charger at home.

*It just keeps going.*

## 2. Does LTE Work in the US?

This is the big question for importers.
The bands supported are primarily Asian (B1, B3, B5, B8, B38, B40, B41).
- **T-Mobile:** Partial success. You might get 4G in cities, but expect dropouts in rural areas.
- **AT&T / Verizon:**Generally**not recommended** due to whitelist restrictions.

If you are buying this for standalone LTE in the States, proceed with caution. It works best as a Bluetooth companion with insane stamina.

## 3. The Interchangeable Bezel: A Gimmick?

Xiaomi’s unique selling point is the twist-lock bezel. You can swap from a "Chronograph" style to a "Sport" style in seconds.
Honestly? It’s cooler than I thought. It feels premium—something akin to a mechanical watch customization, not a cheap toy.
At an import price of roughly **~$180 USD**, the build quality is shocking.

## 4. Emergency Backup Device

For preppers or those living in hurricane-prone zones (Florida/Texas), this watch is an interesting backup.
Even if you don't use LTE daily, popping in a cheap prepaid eSIM (if compatible) means you have a **3-day survival phone** on your wrist that doesn't need daily charging.

## Verdict: Buy or Pass?

**Buy it if:**
- You hate daily charging.
- You want a premium look for under $200.
- You are on T-Mobile (and check your local bands).
- You want to try HyperOS 2.

**Pass if:**
- You need guaranteed LTE coverage everywhere in the US.
- You want seamless iMessage integration (Apple users, stay away).

For $180, it puts US smartwatches to shame in pure endurance.

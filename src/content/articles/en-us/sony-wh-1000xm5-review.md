## Bottom line: **Worth every penny. But if you own the previous model, think twice.** The noise cancellation is truly top-tier. That said, upgrading from the XM4 feels a bit underwhelming. ## What I liked ### 1. Enhanced noise cancellation. Trains become almost silent. Cafe chatter fades to background noise.

### 2. Lighter Feel Despite the weight staying at 250g (strangely feels lighter). Improved ear pads reduce pressure. ### 3. Enhanced Call Quality Eight mics clearly pick up your voice. Great for remote meetings. ## Concerns

- No longer foldable - Price exceeds $335 - Minimal difference from XM4 ## Comparison with Previous Model (XM4) | Item | XM4 | XM5 | |------|------|------| | Noise Cancellation | ◎ | ◎+ |
| Comfort | ○ | ◎ | | Portability | ◎ | △ | | Price | $235 | $335 | ## Summary If buying new, the XM5 is definitely recommended. XM4 users can keep using theirs until they break.

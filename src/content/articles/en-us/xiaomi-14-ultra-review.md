## Introduction The Xiaomi 14 Ultra is the ultimate camera smartphone, born from a collaboration with Leica. After using it intensively for a month, I'll share my thoughts, starting with the **bottom line**. **Bottom Line: If you prioritize camera quality, this is an absolute must-buy** ## The Power of the Leica Camera ### Daytime Photography

Honestly, I was surprised myself, as I never expected much from smartphone cameras before. The color reproduction is truly outstanding. - The balance between sharpness and bokeh is exquisite - The Leica color profile captures atmospheric photos - The 1-inch sensor delivers strong low-light performance ### Night Photography Even without Night Mode, it captures images quite brightly. Noise reduction is natural, avoiding that unnatural, painted-over look.

## Benefits Discovered Through Actual Use 1. **Camera Performance Rivaling DSLRs** - RAW shooting possible in Pro mode 2. **Effective Heat Management** - No worries during extended shooting sessions 3. **Excellent Fast Charging** - Fully charged in 30 minutes with 90W ## Points to Note - The body is quite heavy (approx. 220g) - Large camera bump protrusion - Price is on the higher side (approx. ¥150,000) ## Summary For gadget enthusiasts in their 30s who prioritize camera quality, this is the ultimate choice. While the price is high, it's well worth the investment.

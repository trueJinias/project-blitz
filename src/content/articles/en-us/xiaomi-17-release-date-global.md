## Conclusion: Likely Announcement at MWC in March 2026
**The global version of the Xiaomi 17 series is highly likely to be announced in conjunction with "MWC 2026," held in Barcelona from March 5th to 6th, 2026.** Based on past trends, the global launch approximately three months after the Chinese announcement (late 2025) aligns with established patterns.

"Wait, what about the Japan release?"
Honestly, the Japan launch will likely be delayed by several more months... (As always, it feels like an eternity).

## Expected Lineup
While China will see four models, the global version might be slightly scaled back?

- **Xiaomi 17 (Standard)**: Compact flagship with a 6.31-inch display
- **Xiaomi 17 Ultra**: Top-tier model with monster camera capabilities
- **Pro / Pro Max**: Likely China-exclusive (sad but true)

## Key Spec Highlights

### 1. Battery Capacity Changes

Here's where you need to pay attention. While the Chinese version packs a monster 7,000mAh battery, rumors suggest the **global version will be downsized to 6,330mAh (Ultra to 6,000mAh)**. You might want to yell "Why reduce it?!", but differences in safety standards might be a factor (though it's still plenty big).

### 2. Chipset
This is definitely the **Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5**. No worries about performance whatsoever. Might even be overkill (lol).

### 3. Price
Leaked European prices are as follows:
- **Xiaomi 17**: €1,099 (approx. $1,139)
- **Xiaomi 17 Ultra**: €1,499 (approx. $1,608)

...Given the weak yen, brace yourself for the Japanese price (your wallet might take a hit).

## [Our Take] What Japanese Users Should Do Now
Precisely because there's still time before launch, there are preparations to make.

### 1. Check the Used Market Price for Xiaomi 14/15 Ultra
When new models launch, older models' prices drop. If you're thinking "I don't need the latest model," waiting for the price drop of older models right after the Xiaomi 17 announcement might be a smart move.

### 2. Secure a personal import route
For those who can't wait for the Japanese release, consider importing the global version (like the Hong Kong model). While there are technical compliance issues, it's the only way to get it the fastest.

## Summary
The Xiaomi 17 global version is **highly likely to arrive in March 2026**! Specs and price are expected to be monster-level, but that just makes the excitement unstoppable. Will you buy it? Or wait and see? (Personally... I'm so excited about the Ultra I can't sleep at night!)

### ① KableCARD
**"The Digital Survival Kit"**
The absolute essential for modern life. It’s the size of a credit card but packs 6 cable adapters, a SIM ejector tool, ambient light, wireless charging, and a phone stand.

### ② Leatherman Style PS

### ④ Titanium Pry Bar
**"Minimalist Utility"**
A rising trend in the EDC community. It’s a simple, solid piece of machined titanium used for prying open boxes, acting as a flathead driver, or opening bottles. It saves your knife tip from breaking.

**Pros I found after using it:**

### ⑤ Orbitkey + Multi-Tool Addon
**"The Key Organizer Hack"**
Stop the "jingle-jangle." Orbitkey organizes your keys into a silent stack. Add their slim multi-tool insert (bottle opener, wrench, box cutter) to turn your key stack into a functional tool.
-   **Key Feature:** Elegant leather loops that elevate your style.

**Pros I found after using it:**

- Protects your phone screen from scratches in your bag

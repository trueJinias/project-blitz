## Introduction

The "Old Money" aesthetic is everywhere on social media. Think: generational wealth, Ivy League vibes, quiet confidence.

But here's the issue: brands like Brunello Cucinelli and Loro Piana charge **hundreds** (sometimes thousands) of dollars for a single sweater.

Good news: **You don't need rich-guy brands to look like old money.** Uniqlo — yes, the same store where you buy $15 t-shirts — has everything you need.

Here's how to build a complete Old Money wardrobe on a budget.

## 1. The 5 Rules of Old Money Style

Before we get into specifics, understand the principles:

-   **Quality fabrics** – Cashmere, merino wool, linen, premium cotton
-   **Classic silhouettes** – No trendy cuts; timeless shapes only
-   **Perfect fit** – Not too tight, not too loose
-   **Muted colors** – Navy, beige, gray, cream, white
-   **No logos** – Visible branding is for new money

Uniqlo checks all five boxes.

## 2. Spring/Summer Old Money Outfit

### Outfit 1: Polo + Wide Trousers

Channel your inner country club member.

-   **Top**: Airism cotton polo (white or navy)
-   **Bottom**: Pleated wide-leg trousers (gray or beige)
-   **Shoes**: Leather loafers

Pro tip: **Tuck in your polo.** It instantly elevates the look.

### Outfit 2: Linen Shirt + Chinos

Mediterranean vacation vibes.

-   **Top**: Premium linen shirt (white)
-   **Bottom**: Regular fit chinos (khaki or navy)
-   **Shoes**: Boat shoes or clean white sneakers

Embrace the wrinkles — they're part of linen's charm.

## 3. Fall/Winter Old Money Outfit

### Outfit 1: Fine Gauge Knit + Tailored Pants

Think: Kennedy family on Cape Cod.

-   **Top**: Extra Fine Merino V-neck sweater (navy or gray)
-   **Bottom**: Smart ankle pants (charcoal)
-   **Layer**: Wool blend overcoat

Layer a white Oxford shirt underneath the sweater for that preppy touch.

### Outfit 2: Cardigan + Oxford Shirt + Chinos

British university professor energy.

-   **Outer**: Cashmere blend cardigan (camel)
-   **Under**: Broadcloth Oxford shirt (white or light blue)
-   **Bottom**: Regular fit chinos (beige)

You can even throw the cardigan over your shoulders if you're feeling extra.

## 4. What NOT to Wear

If you're going for Old Money, avoid:

-   ❌ Graphic tees
-   ❌ Distressed denim
-   ❌ Visible logos or branding
-   ❌ Bright colors or neon
-   ❌ Overly baggy fits

The goal is to look like you didn't try too hard. Effortless elegance.

## 5. Affordable Accessories to Complete the Look

Since the clothes are simple, accessories add personality:

-   **Watch**: Minimalist leather strap (no flashy sports watches)
-   **Belt**: Genuine leather, no big buckles
-   **Shoes**: Penny loafers, boat shoes, or clean white leather sneakers
-   **Bag**: Leather tote or simple briefcase

You can find all of these on Amazon for under $100 total.

## Conclusion

Old Money style isn't about how much you spend — it's about **knowing what to buy and how to wear it.**

Uniqlo gives you access to quality basics at budget prices. With under $300, you can build a wardrobe that looks like it cost 10 times more.

Now go forth and dress like you have a trust fund.

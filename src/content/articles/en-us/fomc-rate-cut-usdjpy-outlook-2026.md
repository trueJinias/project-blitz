## Introduction

"Higher for longer" was the story of 2024 and 2025. In 2026, investors are still waiting for the Fed to cut rates.

The January 2026 FOMC meeting came and went with **no rate cut**—the third consecutive hold. Chair Powell signaled patience, not urgency.

So when will the Fed finally cut? And what does it mean for your investments? Let's break it down.

## 1. What Happened at the January FOMC

Key takeaways from the January 27-28 meeting:

-   **Rate decision**: Fed funds rate held at 3.50–3.75%
-   **Rationale**: Strong economic activity and stable labor markets
-   **Powell's message**: "We're in a good position to assess the timing of future adjustments"

Translation: We're not in a hurry.

## 2. When Will the Fed Cut Rates?

Wall Street is divided:

| Firm | Rate Cut Forecast | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| Goldman Sachs | Q3 2026 | Dependent on inflation data |
| JP Morgan | Q4 2026 | If labor market weakens |
| Some analysts | 2027 or later | Possible rate hike if inflation persists |

**The wildcard: Trump's influence.**

President Trump has been vocal about wanting lower rates. If he nominates a dovish Fed Chair before the March FOMC, we could see a faster pivot to cuts.

## 3. What This Means for the Dollar

The US dollar has remained strong, with USD/JPY around 157 (as of early February 2026).

**2026 outlook:**

-   **H1**: Dollar strength likely to continue
-   **H2**: Gradual weakening possible if Fed signals cuts
-   **Year-end**: Could drift lower if rate differentials narrow

But if Trump explicitly endorses a weaker dollar, expect volatility.

## 4. Investing Strategy: What to Do Now

**What NOT to do:**
-   Don't try to time the Fed. Even the experts get it wrong.
-   Don't over-leverage on currency bets.

**What TO do:**
-   **Diversify internationally** – A weaker dollar helps foreign equity returns.
-   **Consider short-duration bonds** – Less interest rate risk.
-   **Stay the course** – Volatility is normal. Don't panic sell.

If you're holding USD-denominated assets, hedging strategies are worth considering.

## Conclusion

The Fed is in no hurry to cut rates in early 2026. The economy is too strong, and inflation is not cooperating.

Expect rate cuts **later in 2026**, but don't be surprised if they get pushed to 2027.

For investors, the best strategy is **staying diversified and avoiding speculation** on Fed timing. The next few months will be noisy—block out the noise and focus on long-term goals.

## Introduction

"New NISA? Just put it all in All Country (Global Stocks), right?"

That was the correct answer when the system started in 2024. However, the situation in 2026 is slightly different.
With US stocks hitting historic highs and concerns about "overvaluation" growing, new growth engines are emerging.

In this article, we explain the "Updated Ultimate Portfolio" for the 2026 market environment and the notable new systems starting this year.

## 1. Core Asset: The Throne of "All Country" is Unshaken

First, the conclusion: The superiority of "eMAXIS Slim All Country" as the core of your portfolio remains unshaken in 2026.

It continues to dominate the rankings at major brokerages like Rakuten and SBI.
The reason is simple: **"Ultimate Diversification"**.
Even if the US stumbles, other countries will cover it. This sense of security is more important than anything else in long-term investment over 20-30 years.

If in doubt, fill 80% of your installment investment quota with this.

## 2. Satellite Strategy: From FANG+ to "India Stocks"

The change is happening in the "Satellite Quota" (mainly the Growth Investment Quota), where you aim for higher returns with the remaining 20-30%.

In 2024-2025, "FANG+" (concentrated investment in Google, Amazon, etc.) was popular.
However, in 2026, many investors are shifting their funds to **"India Stocks (Nifty50, etc.)"**.

### Why India Now?
- **Demographic Dividend**: Surpassed China to become the world's most populous nation, with an abundant labor force.
- **GDP Growth**: Maintaining high growth in the 7% range.
- **Undervalued**: Compared to US tech stocks, there is still significant room for long-term appreciation.

"After the US, comes India." The number of investors riding this narrative is increasing rapidly.

## 3. The Highlight of 2026: The Impact of "Minor NISA"

And this year, the biggest news in terms of the system is the **"Expansion of Installment Investment Quota Eligibility (Minors)"**.

It can be said to be a practical revival of the former "Junior NISA", but this time it has evolved to be easier to use.
- **Target**: Under 18 (Managed by parents)
- **Quota**: Around 600,000 yen per year (Under adjustment)
- **Tax-Free Period**: Indefinite

As a result, "Index Funds Managed by Parents" are becoming the optimal solution for saving for "Education Funds", replacing traditional educational endowment insurance.
"Buy VTI (Total US Stock Market) as soon as a child is born" — this is becoming the common sense for parents in 2026.

## 4. 2026 Edition: Ultimate Portfolio Proposal

Based on these, here is the ideal allocation proposal for 2026.

### [Stable Growth Type]
- **All Country (80%)**: The foundation.
- **India Stocks (10%)**: Spice for growth.
- **Japan High-Dividend Stocks (10%)**: Hedge against weak yen & Cash flow.

### [Aggressive Investment Type]
- **S&P 500 (60%)**: Still believing in US strength.
- **FANG+ (20%)**: Aiming for remaining profits from the AI bubble.
- **India/Vietnam Stocks (20%)**: Emerging market dream.

## Summary

The investment keyword for 2026 is **"De-concentration from US-only"**.
US stocks are still powerful, but relying solely on them is becoming riskier.

The new engine called India, and the system revision that allows the whole family to use the quotas.
Make full use of these to accelerate your asset formation one step further.

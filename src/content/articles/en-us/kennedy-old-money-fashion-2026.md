If you want to learn Old Money style, study the **Kennedys**.

For over 60 years, this American dynasty has defined understated elegance. Two women in particular — **Jacqueline Kennedy** and **Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy** — became icons of quiet luxury.

Here's what we can learn from them.

## 1. Jackie Kennedy's Style

As First Lady in the 1960s, Jackie became the face of **American elegance**.

**Her Signature Pieces:**
-   **Shift dresses**: Clean A-line silhouettes
-   **Pillbox hats**: Small, elegant headpieces
-   **Pearl necklaces**: Her famous quote: "Pearls are always appropriate"
-   **Chanel suits**: Pastel tweed sets
-   **Oversized sunglasses**: Her trademark accessory

Jackie proved that **class beats flash** — every time.

## 2. Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy's Style

JFK Jr.'s wife Carolyn pioneered **quiet luxury** before it had a name.

**Her Uniform:**
-   **White shirt + jeans**: Simple perfection
-   **Black slip dress**: The Calvin Klein iconic piece
-   **Beige trench coat**: Elegant outerwear
-   **Minimal heels**: Clean, understated

Carolyn showed that luxury isn't about logos — it's about fit, fabric, and confidence.

## 3. The 5 Shared Principles

Despite different eras, both women followed the same rules:

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Timeless** | Classic over trendy |
| **Quality fabrics** | Cashmere, silk, fine cotton |
| **Perfect fit** | Tailored to your body |
| **Neutral palette** | White, black, navy, beige |
| **Understated details** | No loud logos or flashy jewelry |

## 4. How to Apply This Today

Build your Kennedy-inspired wardrobe:

**Invest In:**
-   A quality white blouse or Oxford shirt
-   A navy blazer (unstructured for modern)
-   Tailored trousers in beige or grey
-   Simple pearl earrings or necklace
-   Leather loafers or classic pumps

**Avoid:**
-   Giant logos
-   Busy prints
-   Trend-driven pieces
-   Cheap-looking fabrics

## 5. For Men: The JFK Approach

The Kennedy men had their own uniform:

-   **Navy blazer + white pants**: Cape Cod chic
-   **Polo shirt + chinos**: Relaxed elegance
-   **Penny loafers**: Sockless in summer
-   **Simple timepiece**: No flashy sports watches

## Conclusion

The Kennedy style endures because it prioritizes **timeless beauty over trends**.

Real Old Money fashion isn't about buying expensive logos. It's about owning fewer, better pieces and wearing them with confidence.

Start today: Look at your closet and ask — will this still look good in 10 years?

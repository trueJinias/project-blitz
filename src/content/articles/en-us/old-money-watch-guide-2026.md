In Old Money style, **your watch says everything**.

It's the one accessory that instantly reveals your taste and sophistication. A flashy diamond-encrusted chronograph screams "new money." A subtle vintage dress watch whispers "generational wealth."

Here's how to choose the right one.

## 1. The 3 Rules of Old Money Watches

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Simple design** | Timeless elegance that never dates |
| **Modest size** | 36-40mm is most refined |
| **Leather or simple metal** | Avoid flashy bracelets |

**Skip the chunky dive watches and loud chronographs.** Old Money doesn't let the watch do the talking.

### 1. Cartier Tank

The **ultimate** Old Money watch.

-   Designed in 1917 — over a century of elegance
-   Rectangular case exudes sophistication
-   Must Tank models start around $3,000 vintage
-   Worn by Jackie Kennedy

Wearing a Tank signals **"I understand real luxury."**

### 2. Rolex Oyster Perpetual

Not sports Rolex — the **dress Oyster**.

-   Vintage 34-36mm references (like Ref. 1003)
-   Simpler than Datejust
-   Prices from $4,000-$6,000 for vintage
-   Robust enough for daily wear

Avoid the Submariner or GMT Master — too attention-seeking for Old Money.

### 3. Patek Philippe Calatrava

If budget allows, **this is the pinnacle**.

-   The ultimate dress watch
-   Simple three-hand design
-   Vintage starts around $10,000
-   Signals "I don't need to prove anything"

Nobody wearing a Calatrava is trying to impress you.

## 3. Watches to Avoid

For Old Money credibility, skip these:

-   ❌ Gold cases with flashy diamonds
-   ❌ Oversized sports watches (45mm+)
-   ❌ Busy chronographs
-   ❌ Prominent brand logos on dial
-   ❌ Rubber strap casual watches

Richard Mille and Hublot — no matter the price — scream new money.

## 4. Buying Vintage: What to Know

When shopping for vintage:

**Before you buy, check:**
-   Original dial and hands
-   Service history (regular overhauls needed)
-   Don't expect waterproofing
-   Buy from reputable specialists

**Best era: 1960s-1970s.** These balance vintage charm with practical reliability.

## 5. Budget Guide

| Budget | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Under $2,000** | Vintage Omega Seamaster or Grand Seiko |
| **$2,000-5,000** | Cartier Must Tank |
| **$5,000-10,000** | Vintage Rolex Oyster Perpetual |
| **$10,000+** | Patek Philippe Calatrava |

## Conclusion

An Old Money watch is about **understated elegance**.

Choose simple, modest, and timeless. Your wrist will thank you — and so will everyone who notices.

Take your time. A watch is forever.

**Is Greenland safe? How much does it cost?**

The world's largest island. Northern lights, glaciers, untouched wilderness — a bucket list destination for many. But what about **safety and budget**?

Short answer: Safety is **excellent** — one of the world's safest places. But prices are **2-3x higher than most Western countries**, and tours regularly exceed **$10,000**.

Here's your 2026 guide to Greenland travel.

## 1. Safety: Among the World's Safest

Greenland is **extremely safe** for travelers.

**Why it's safe:**
-   Crime rates are exceptionally low
-   Pickpocketing, theft, and scams are virtually unheard of
-   Small population (~56,000) creates tight-knit communities
-   No travel warnings from major governments

**Real risks to consider:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Extreme cold/blizzards** | Proper gear essential |
| **Glacier calving** | Join guided tours only |
| **Trekking falls** | Experienced guides |

The biggest danger isn't crime — it's **Mother Nature**. Winter blizzards can be life-threatening. Prepare accordingly.

## 2. Cost of Living: 2-3x Western Prices

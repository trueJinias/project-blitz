## Introduction: How Long Must We Wait for Suica Support?

"This time for sure!"

Hello to all the Xiaomi fans who expect this every year only to be betrayed. I'm Namo-ni.

The <strong>Xiaomi Smart Band 10</strong>, released in 2025. It has a beautiful screen, great battery life, and a bug-like price. But<strong>it lacked the crucial "FeliCa (Osaifu-Keitai)" feature</strong>.

"If only it could use Suica, it would be invincible..."

Hearing such sighs, eyes are already turning to the next model, the <strong>"Xiaomi Smart Band 11 (tentative)"</strong>. Will this 11th-generation milestone model finally include the feature Japan has been longing for?

In this article, we seriously predict the <strong>"Probability of Suica support in Xiaomi Smart Band 11"</strong> based on technical hurdles, costs, and Xiaomi's strategy for the Japanese market.

## 1. Why Did the Japanese Version of Xiaomi Smart Band 10 Lack FeliCa?

The biggest reasons why the anticipated FeliCa support was skipped in Band 10 are presumed to be <strong>"Cost" and the "Barrier of Global Standardization"</strong>.

### The Cost Barrier
Integrating a FeliCa chip requires licensing fees to Sony and hardware costs. The greatest weapon of the Xiaomi Smart Band series is its "affordability, purchasable for around 5,000 yen". If loading FeliCa pushes the price to 8,000 or 9,000 yen, that appeal is halved.

### The Global Expansion Dilemma
While the Japanese market is important to Xiaomi, it is just one part of a huge global market. Creating and managing a <strong>"Japan-exclusive circuit board"</strong> just for Japan reduces production line efficiency. Bringing the global model "as is" is the cheapest option.

## 2. Is the Probability of Suica Support in Xiaomi Smart Band 11 "50%"?

So, what about the Band 11 expected in 2026? I predict there is a <strong>"50% chance of support"</strong>.

### Tailwind: Market Share Expansion in Japan
Xiaomi has rapidly increased its presence in the Japanese market in recent years. Launching not just smartphones but tablets and home appliances. Now that brand recognition has risen, the next target is the seat of the <strong>"National Smart Band"</strong>. To achieve that, supporting "Suica", a vital infrastructure for Japanese life, is unavoidable.

### Headwind: The Spread of QR Payments
On the other hand, QR code payments like PayPay have completely taken root. While the need to pass through ticket gates with a wristwatch is strong, more people are thinking, "I can just show my smartphone screen for convenience store payments." There is a sufficient possibility that Xiaomi judges "the merit of adding FeliCa at the cost of higher prices is thin."

## 3. What Will the Price Be If Supported?

If the Xiaomi Smart Band 11 includes FeliCa, I expect the price to be <strong>around 7,000 to 8,980 yen</strong>.

- <strong>Standard Edition (No NFC)</strong>: 5,980 yen
- <strong>Japan Edition (with FeliCa)</strong>: 7,980 yen

Deploying it as a higher-end model like this seems realistic. Considering the Fitbit Charge 6 is over 20,000 yen, just the fact that <strong>"you can use Suica for under 10,000 yen"</strong> gives it the potential to dominate the market.

## 4. The "Budget FeliCa Band" Market Has No Rivals

Currently, there are surprisingly few choices for smartwatches/bands that can use Suica in Japan.

1.  <strong>Apple Watch</strong>: The strongest but expensive (from 60,000 yen), iPhone required.
2.  <strong>Pixel Watch</strong>: The hope for Android users, but battery life is an issue (from 50,000 yen).
3.  <strong>Fitbit Charge 6</strong>: The only band-type option, but a bit pricey at around 23,000 yen.
4.  <strong>Sony wena</strong>: A buckle type. Very niche.

As you can see, the <strong>"under 10,000 yen entry class" is a vacuum</strong>. The only one who can fill this is Xiaomi, with its global mass production scale.

## Conclusion: Use "Band 10" to the Fullest and Wait

In conclusion, Suica support in Xiaomi Smart Band 11 is <strong>"fifty-fifty"</strong>. However, if it is supported, it will be a moment that changes the history of the Japanese wearable market.

If you thought, "Well, I'll wait until it comes out," <strong>that's a loss.</strong>The current<strong>Xiaomi Smart Band 10</strong>, barring payment functions, is close to perfection in terms of screen brightness, smooth operation, and battery life. Since you can buy it for the 5,000 yen range, just using it for a year while waiting for the 2026 Band 11 is enough to get your money's worth.

First, get used to "life with a secretary on your wrist" with Band 10, and wait while dreaming of "ticket gate dashes" being added in Band 11. That might be the smartest behavior for a gadget lover.

How much would you be willing to pay for a "Xiaomi Band with Suica"?

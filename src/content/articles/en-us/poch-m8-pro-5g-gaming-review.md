If you've been typing **"POCH M8 Pro"** into Google, you're not alone. It seems to be a common slip of the finger for the **POCO M8 Pro 5G**.

But honestly? Call it whatever you want, as long as you buy it. Because this phone is shaping up to be the **best budget gaming phone of 2026**.

Forget the typo. Let's talk about why this $300 device is making flagship owners nervous.

## 1. The Specs: Punching Above Its Weight

The POCO M8 Pro 5G isn't just "good for the price." It's just good. Period.

- **Processor**: Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 4 (4nm)
- **Screen**: 6.83" AMOLED, 120Hz Refresh Rate
- **Battery**: Massive 6500mAh
- **Charging**: 100W HyperCharge

The **Snapdragon 7s Gen 4** is the star here. It offers near-flagship performance, handling multitasking and heavy apps with zero stutter. And that 6500mAh battery? It's a weekend warrior's dream.

## 2. Gaming Test: Can It Run Genshin?

The real question for any "gaming" phone: How does it handle *Genshin Impact* and *PUBG Mobile*?

### PUBG Mobile / BGMI

Easy win. The M8 Pro runs PUBG at a **solid 60 FPS** on High settings. If you tweak the config, you can even push it to 90 FPS in supported modes. The touch response rate is snappy, giving you that split-second advantage in close-quarters combat.

### Genshin Impact

The ultimate stress test.
- **Settings**: Medium-High
- **Average FPS**: 55 FPS
- **Stability**: Surprisingly consistent.

While it's not a steady 60 FPS on absolute max settings like a $1000 phone, it's playable and smooth. For a budget device, this is incredible optimization.

## 3. Thermal Performance & Battery Life

Does it get hot? Yes, but not dangerously so.
After an hour of gaming, the phone warms up to about **42°C (107°F)**. It's noticeable but won't burn your hands.

The battery drain is minimal. A full hour of Genshin only took about **12%** off the battery. You could easily game for 6-7 hours straight on a full charge.

## Verdict

So, to all the "**POCH M8 Pro**" searchers out there: You found what you were looking for.

The **POCO M8 Pro 5G** is a beast. If you want high-end gaming performance without the high-end price tag, correct your typo and add this to your cart.

## Introduction

With the rollout of high-speed fiber across Indian cities, the demand for capable routers is at an all-time high. Enter the **Xiaomi Mesh System BE3600 Pro**, a budget-friendly Wi-Fi 7 router that promises top-tier performance without the premium price tag.

Priced around **₹8,500** (imported estimate), it aims to disrupt the market currently dominated by TP-Link and Netgear. But does it deliver? We put it to the test.

## 1. Specifications & Pricing in India

While not efficiently launched in India *yet*, the BE3600 Pro is making waves in the global import market.

| Feature | Spec |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Standard** | Wi-Fi 7 (BE3600) |
| **Speed** | 3600 Mbps (Aggregated) |
| **Ports** | 1x 2.5GbE WAN/LAN, 3x 1GbE LAN |
| **Processor** | Qualcomm Quad-Core 1.1GHz |
| **Price** | ~₹8,500 (Import) |

For Indian gamers and heavy streamers, the inclusion of a **2.5GbE port** is a game-changer, especially if you're on a 1Gbps plan from JioFiber or Airtel Xstream.

## 2. Speed Test: Is Wi-Fi 7 Real?

We tested the router in a typical 3BHK Indian apartment (concrete walls).

### 5GHz Performance
*   **Close Range (Same Room):** 2.8 Gbps (Insanely fast)
*   **Long Range (2 Walls):** 850 Mbps

Even through thick concrete walls, the signal remained strong enough for 4K streaming on Netflix and uninterrupted gaming on BGMI.

## 3. Gaming Performance

For Indian gamers, latency is king. 

*   **BGMI / COD Mobile:** Stable 20ms ping.
*   **Console Gaming (PS5):** No lag spikes observed.

The dedicated "Gaming Mode" (when using Xiaomi phones) works surprisingly well to prioritize traffic.

## 4. Verdict: Should You Import?

**Pros:**
*   **Value for Money:** Unbeatable specs for under ₹10k.
*   **Design:** Sleek, antenna-less design fits modern Indian homes.
*   **Easy Setup:** Mi Home servers work seamlessly.

**Cons:**
*   **Availability:** Currently reliance on Grey Market/Imports.
*   **Plug:** Requires an adapter for Indian sockets.

**Conclusion:** If you can get your hands on it, the **Xiaomi Mesh System BE3600 Pro** is easily the best value Wi-Fi 7 router for Indian users right now. It's significantly cheaper than comparable options from Asus or Netgear available on Amazon India.

## Namaste Techies!

The smartwatch market in India is heating up—literally and figuratively. With the <strong>Xiaomi Watch S4</strong>landing around<strong>₹14,999 (Effectively)</strong>, it goes straight for the throat of the OnePlus Watch 2R and Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 FE.

But specs on paper don't tell the whole story. We tested it in the Delhi heat to see if it survives.

## 1. Battery Life: 15 Days or Just Marketing?

Xiaomi claims up to 15 days. In our testing with Jio eSIM enabled:
- <strong>Typical Usage (LTE):</strong><strong>4 Days</strong> solid.
- <strong>Heavy Usage (GPS + Calls):</strong> 2.5 Days.

Compared to the Galaxy Watch 6 (which needs charging every evening), this is a relief. It charges fully in about <strong>65 minutes</strong>, which is decent for a morning rush.

## 2. Heating Issues in Indian Summer?

One concern with LTE watches is heat. During a 10-minute call outdoors (38°C ambient temp), the watch did get <strong>noticeably warm</strong>.
It didn't shut down, but HyperOS dimmed the screen brightness to protect the device.
If you plan to talk for hours on your wrist while riding a bike in traffic—maybe use a headset instead.

## 3. Value for Money: S4 vs OnePlus Watch 2

| Feature | Xiaomi Watch S4 | OnePlus Watch 2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <strong>Price</strong>|<strong>~₹15k</strong> | ~₹20k |
| <strong>OS</strong> | HyperOS 2 (Smooth) | WearOS (More Apps) |
| <strong>Battery</strong>|<strong>15 Days</strong> | 4 Days |
| <strong>Bezel</strong>|<strong>Interchangeable</strong> | Fixed |

The <strong>Interchangeable Bezel</strong> is the killer feature here. You can change the look from "Office Formal" to "Gym Mode" instantly. For the price difference, Xiaomi offers better hardware versatility.

## 4. Connectivity: Jio & Airtel

We tested with <strong>Jio</strong>and<strong>Airtel</strong> eSIMs.
- <strong>Jio:</strong> Worked flawlessly. VoLTE calls were crisp.
- <strong>Airtel:</strong> Setup took a few tries across the Mi Fitness app region settings.

Ensure your region is set to "India" in the app for the smoothest onboarding.

## Verdict: The Practical Choice

At <strong>~₹15,000</strong>, the Xiaomi Watch S4 is the<strong>Value King</strong>.
It lacks the app ecosystem of WearOS (no WhatsApp typing support yet), but for notification triage, calls, and pure battery endurance, it beats everything else in this segment.

<strong>Pros:</strong>
- Insane battery life for an LTE watch.
- Premium, customizable design.
- Great price point.

<strong>Cons:</strong>
- Gets warm on long calls.
- App ecosystem is smaller than WearOS.

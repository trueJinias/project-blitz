## Namaste Techies!

The smartwatch market in India is heating up—literally and figuratively. With the **Xiaomi Watch S4**landing around**₹14,999 (Effectively)**, it goes straight for the throat of the OnePlus Watch 2R and Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 FE.

But specs on paper don't tell the whole story. We tested it in the Delhi heat to see if it survives.

## 1. Battery Life: 15 Days or Just Marketing?

Xiaomi claims up to 15 days. In our testing with Jio eSIM enabled:
- **Typical Usage (LTE):****4 Days** solid.
- **Heavy Usage (GPS + Calls):** 2.5 Days.

Compared to the Galaxy Watch 6 (which needs charging every evening), this is a relief. It charges fully in about **65 minutes**, which is decent for a morning rush.

## 2. Heating Issues in Indian Summer?

One concern with LTE watches is heat. During a 10-minute call outdoors (38°C ambient temp), the watch did get **noticeably warm**.
It didn't shut down, but HyperOS dimmed the screen brightness to protect the device.
If you plan to talk for hours on your wrist while riding a bike in traffic—maybe use a headset instead.

## 3. Value for Money: S4 vs OnePlus Watch 2

| Feature | Xiaomi Watch S4 | OnePlus Watch 2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Price**|**~₹15k** | ~₹20k |
| **OS** | HyperOS 2 (Smooth) | WearOS (More Apps) |
| **Battery**|**15 Days** | 4 Days |
| **Bezel**|**Interchangeable** | Fixed |

The **Interchangeable Bezel** is the killer feature here. You can change the look from "Office Formal" to "Gym Mode" instantly. For the price difference, Xiaomi offers better hardware versatility.

## 4. Connectivity: Jio & Airtel

We tested with **Jio**and**Airtel** eSIMs.
- **Jio:** Worked flawlessly. VoLTE calls were crisp.
- **Airtel:** Setup took a few tries across the Mi Fitness app region settings.

Ensure your region is set to "India" in the app for the smoothest onboarding.

## Verdict: The Practical Choice

At **~₹15,000**, the Xiaomi Watch S4 is the**Value King**.
It lacks the app ecosystem of WearOS (no WhatsApp typing support yet), but for notification triage, calls, and pure battery endurance, it beats everything else in this segment.

**Pros:**
- Insane battery life for an LTE watch.
- Premium, customizable design.
- Great price point.

**Cons:**
- Gets warm on long calls.
- App ecosystem is smaller than WearOS.
